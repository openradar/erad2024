title: "ERAD 2024 Open Radar Science Shortcourse"
abstract: "The course will discuss the principles of open science and provide an overview of the most mature
and exciting software packages available for radar data processing (ex. LROSE, Py-ART, pyrad, BAL-
TRAD, wradlib) and how they connect with the scientific software stack.
The course will be built with Jupyter Notebooks as hands-on approach for interactive user experi-
ence. The main course programming language is Python, but also Command Line Tools are used.
The course will also highlight the “xradar” package, implementing the newly adopted
FM301/CfRadial2 WMO standard, as well as the gpm-api software, which facilitates the
download and analysis of TRMM PR and GPM DPR spaceborne radars data. These two tools will be
used to showcase how to harness the power of xarray and dask for efficient, distributed radar data
processing.
The course will cover operational use (e.g. in HPC environments or Cloud Infrastructure) as well as
algorithm development, enabling the participants to implement their own algorithms.
The course will also show how to create workflows for different aspects of weather radar
data processing, using open datasets relevant to the attendees and ERAD 2024"
