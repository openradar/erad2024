    "# QPE Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to practice with the Pyrad config files to create a QPE processing data chain. The following data will be used:\n",
    "- [Rain gauge data from ARPA Lombardia](https://www.arpalombardia.it/temi-ambientali/meteo-e-clima/guida-richiesta-dati/).\n",
    "- [X-band radar data provided by ARPA Lombardia](https://www.arpalombardia.it/temi-ambientali/meteo-e-clima/radar-meteo/).\n",
    "- [Radar data from the MeteoSwiss radar at Monte Lema](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/precipitation.html).\n",
    "- [Rain gauge data from MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/measurement-values-and-measuring-networks.html#param=messwerte-niederschlag-10min&table=false)\n",
    "  \n",
    "We have prepared for you a stub of the 3 config files to process the X-band radar data. Have a look at them here:\n",
    "- [main config file](../../pyrad/config/qpe.txt)\n",
    "- [loc config file](../../pyrad/config/qpe_loc.txt)\n",
    "- [prod config file](../../pyrad/config/qpe_prod.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you execute pyrad using this config file you will get a projection on a map of the reflectivity of the 2nd elevation. Let's try that:\n",
    "1. Open the terminal\n",
    "2. Go to *erad2024/pyrad/config*\n",
    "3. execute: `main_process_data.py qpe.txt --starttime 20240522160000 --endtime 20240522160000 --cfgpath ./`\n",
    "4. The created image is stored in the directory *erad2024/pyrad/pyrad_outputs/QPE_ARPA2/2024-05-22/dBZ/EL1.3/*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Exploring the raw data\n",
    "Can you generate similar maps for ZDR, RhoHV, KDP and PhiDP? \n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at other elevations as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Could you generate a pseudo-RHI for an azimuth of interest? *(hint: a pseudo-ppi map is generated using the PSEUDORHI_IMAGE product)* \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Clutter filtering\n",
    "Generate an echoID dataset using the sanity check SAN process and filter all the data using the ECHO_FILTER dataset generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Attenuation correction\n",
    "Correct the reflectivity and the differential reflectivity using the ATTENUATION process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4: Hydrometeor classification\n",
    "Use the semi-supervised hydrometeor classification in the HYDROCLASS process to obtain an hydro dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 5: Rainfall rate estimation\n",
    "Use the hydro method in the RAINRATE process to get the rainfall rate\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 6: Comparing radar rainfall rate with rain gauge measurements\n",
    "Extract data at a point using the POINT_MEASUREMENT process and generate rain gauge-radar comparisons using TIME_SERIES products. The following rain gauges are available:\n",
    "- 45.8500,8.0000 COL (Coldrerio)\n",
    "- 45.843, 8.932 SBO (Stabio)\n",
    "- 45.843, 8.932 GEN (Monte Generoso)\n",
    "- 45.8333, 8.8167 IYVAV (Masnago)\n",

    "- 45.6833,9.1833 IYVEM (Vertemate)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 7: Projection into regular grid\n",
    "Project the rainfall rate estimation into a regular grid using the GRID process. Plot the rainfall rate at several elevations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus questions:\n",
    "- Use other rainfall rate estimators available on Pyrad\n",
    "- Use alternative KDP processing methods\n",
    "- Create config files to process Monte Lema radar data"
