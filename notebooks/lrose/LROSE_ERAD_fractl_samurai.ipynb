    "This interactive tutorial takes you through the steps of how to run [FRACTL](http://wiki.lrose.net/index.php/FRACTL) and [SAMURAI](http://wiki.lrose.net/index.php/SAMURAI). FRACTL is a fast traditional solver with integrated interpolation using LROSE infrastructure, and it is able to perform both gridding and multi-Doppler synthesis for airborne radars and multiple ground-based radars. This is different than Radx2Grid which is only capable of gridding data for a single ground-based radar. FRACTL adopts techniques from older REORDER and CEDRIC software, but with some new improvements. In contrast to the older tools, in which interpolation is followed by synthesis, FRACTL does both steps together. FRACTL doesn’t require the CfRadial file with an aggregation of the sweeps, which is different than Radx2Grid. FRACTL performs a nearest neighbor interpolation of the reflectivity instead of bilinear interpolation in Radx2Grid. It combines the Doppler velocities together using the traditional 'normal' equations but with singular value decomposition of raw velocities in spherical space rather than Cramer's rule in gridded space like CEDRIC. \n",

    "SAMURAI is a variational analysis technique that is described in [Bell et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-11-0276.1), [Foerster et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00313.1), [Foerster and Bell (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0073.1), [Cha and Bell (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3523-2021), [Cha and Bell (2023)](https://github.com/csu-tropical/csu-tropical/blob/master/Publications/papers/Cha_Bell_JTECH_2023.pdf), and other publications. The SAMURAI analysis yields a maximum likelihood estimate of the atmospheric state for a given set of observations and error estimates by minimizing a variational cost function. SAMMURAI employs a finite element approach using a series of overlapping cubic B-spline basis functions. \n",
    "This approach offers several advantages over a conventional grid-point representation, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allowing for a scaled-controlled analysis that can incorporate multiple spatial filters in the background error covariance and analytic spatial derivatives in observational space.\n",
    "- No need to interpolate irregular data distributions to a Cartesian grid, and the data can be used in the variational minimization in their native locations.\n",
    "- Spatial derivative constraints are considered as pseudo-observations, which can be implicitely integrated during the cost function minimmization at any point in their native coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has more features and more development than FRACTL, and is generally recommended over the former for publication-quality analysis. The two programs together provide a powerful combination to produce high quality multi-Doppler wind fields from ground-based, airborne, or mixed configurations.\n",

    "### 9. Apply FRACTL Condition Number\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRACTL 'Condition Number' represents how well-posed the geometry is for a particular multi-Doppler retrieval. It is similar to the USTD and VSTD field from CEDRIC, which represent the standard deviation of the expected error in the resolved wind field based on the geometry. Since SAMURAI solves for the wind field globally using spline basis functions, it is difficult to calculate this error at each gridpoint. If a FRACTL analysis is run on the same domain, then it can be used to remove regions with poor geometry. Here, we use a value of 10 to threshold the SAMURAI analysis."

    "# Appendix - additional SAMURAI parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are optional parameters:\n",
    "---\n",
    "* **BACKGROUND SECTION**\n",
    "    * load_background [line 107]\n",
    "        * TRUE: A first guess of the analysis stored in the <code lang=\"bash\">samurai_Background.in</code> will be loaded. This can come from a model, sounding, or other data source if available. Most of the time it is not available so it should be set to FALSE.\n",
    "        * FALSE (default setting)\n",
    "    * adjust_background [line 132]\n",
    "        * TRUE: the background will be adjusted to satisfy the mass continuity and match the supplied data using a variational adjustment. Without this, it is just interpolated simply to the grid. \n",
    "* **OPERATION SECTION**\n",
    "    * mode [line 170]: The default mode is MODE_XYZ, which is Cartesian grid. You can run in cylindrical mode with MODE_RTZ. Stay tuned for more radar centric RTZ mode in the near future!\n",
    "    * preprocess_obs [line 219]\n",
    "        * TRUE: the raw data files will be preprocessed according to their file suffixes, and a <code lang=\"bash\">samurai_Observations.in</code> file will be generated.\n",
    "        * FALSE: SAMURAI will load the observations from the <code lang=\"bash\">samurai_Observations.in</code> file located in the data_directory. This is useful for generating fake data, or for saving some time if you already ran the preprocessing of lots of files.\n",
    "    * num_iterations [line 232]: SAMURAI has the ability to take the output analysis and use it as a first guess for another analysis. This can be useful to create a 'coarse' analysis, followed by a 'fine' analysis. It is very important to set the observation and background errors appropriately if you choose this option.\n",
    "* **BACKGROUND SECTION**\n",
    "    * ref_state [line 380]: a sounding file to define the hydrostatic reference state used in the analysis. The default is the Dunion (2011) moist tropical sounding file. The analysis is generally not sensitive to this sounding, as it is just used to provide a reference density field and fall speed relationships in most cases. If you are analyzing thermodynamic information or have a very different freezing level it may be useful to provide a more appropriate sounding. The file format is similar to that of WRF or CM1 idealized soundings.\n",
    "    * i_background_roi [line 402], j_background_roi [line 412]: These set the background radius of influence when loading a background field.\n",
    "* **RADAR SECTION**\n",
    "    * qr_variable [line 452]: In the default 'dbz' mode, the reflectivity is just interpolated and not included in the cost function minimization. If this is set to 'qr', then reflectivity is converted to liquid water using Z-M relationships defined in Gamache et al. (1993) and used as an additional variable in the cost function minimization. This is useful if you have other liquid water measurements to assimilate. Since this is a relatively simple Z-M it should be used with caution. \n",
    "    * dbz_pseudow_weight [line 516]: SAMURAI has the ability to set a 'soft' w=0 boundary condition at echo top, and setting this weight will determine how soft or hard that constraint is enforced. Usually a hard w=0 is enforced via the spline boundary conditions at the bottom and top of the domain, so this is optional. It can be useful if the vertical velocities are believed to be too strong at the top of the cloud.\n",
    "    * melting_zone_width [line 532], mixed_phase_dbz [line 540], rain_dbz [line 548]: SAMURAI has some basic terminal fall speed corrections that use reflectivity and Z-VT relationships. These parameters control which relationships are used depending on dbz and the height of the zero C level (which is determined from the reference sounding).\n",
    "* **BOUNDARY CONDITIONS SECTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Available options are R0, R1T0, R1T1, R1T2, R2T10, R2T20, R3, and PERIODIC following Ooyama (2002). The default \"non\"- boundary condition (R0) adds a buffer set of gridpoints that are used to calculate the solution but are discarded for output. Different boundary conditions can be set on the left (L) or right (R) side of the domain for each variable and dimension. The most common option other than R0 would be R1T0 for vertical velocity (rhow = 0) at the surface and/or domain top. Periodic domains are only valid for the i and j dimension, but are available in both the XYZ and RTZ mode. Improved boundary conditions are currently in development.\n",
    "* **OBSERVATION ERRORS SECTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specified error is given in terms of a standard deviation, and is fixed for all observations from a particular instrument except radar. In the radar case, the spectrum width and elevation angle (proportional to terminal fall speed contribution) are used to define the error for each radar gate. A minimum error (radar_min_error) is also enforced.\n",
    "* **ITERATION DEPENDENT SECTION**\n",
    "    * mc_weight [line 1450]: specify the weight given to the mass continuity constraint. Default is set to 1, and is generally not recommended to change unless you have a good reason.\n",
    "    * i_filter_length [line 1546], j_filter_length [line 1558], k_filter_length [line 1570]\n",
    "     - Gaussian recursive filter is a low-pass filter. Smaller filter lengths retain more detail, and larger filter lengths smooth more. The general recommendation is 4, 4, 2, which removes features less than approximately 4dx, 4dy, and 2dz from the analysis.\n",
    "    * i_spline_cutoff [line 1582], j_spline_cutoff [line 1594], k_spline_cutoff [line 1606]\n",
    "     - Spline cutoff is implemented as a third derivative constraint on the cubic B-spline basis during the spline transform. It is a sharper filter than the Gaussian, roughly equivalent to a sixth order filter.\n",
    "    * i_max_wavenumber [line 1618], j_max_wavenumber [line 1630], k_max_wavenumber [line 1642]\n",
    "     - The Fourier spectral filter is the sharpest filter. It can be used for desired effects, such as explicitly removing high-wavenumber features in the spectral domain (usually for RTZ analysis), or for producing a 'mean' field by restricting to wavenumber zero."
