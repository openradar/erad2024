    "### What Does this look like in the Weather Radar Community?\n",
    "- Since the late 2000s (and even before) there has been a number of major open source projects released (see e.g. https://openradarscience.org).\n",
    "- Some of them are in a mature stage and are widely used in an academic (mostly) but also operational environment\n",
    "- Most make use of modern tools (e.g. github, conda, docker) and practices (e.g. Continuous Integration, automatic tests) that make them easy to evolve and deploy\n",
    "- Most are backed by major weather services or academic institutions\n",
    "Projects are not competing among them but collaborating : Best practices and inter-operability are discussed regularly and joint open source courses have been organized for years at major radar conferences (AMS, ERAD)  "
